# Computes a pairing, i.e. a way to match a group of N people in N pairs,
# where each person belongs to two pairs: one as a teacher and one as a learner
#
# Example:
# Alice     teaches Ruby        to Bob
# Bob       teaches Python      to Carol
# Carol     teaches Javascript  to Alice
#
# To solve this problem we build a graph with:
# - a "Teacher" node and another "Learner" node for each person
# - an edge between a "Teacher" and a "Learner" whenever there is a skill that
#   the Teacher can teach and the Learner wants to learn
#
# Once this is done, building a pairing is equivalent to finding a
# "maximal matching" in the graph, which is a well-known problem in graph theory
# see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)
